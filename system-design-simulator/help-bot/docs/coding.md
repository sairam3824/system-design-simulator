# Coding Challenges

## Overview

The coding challenges feature helps you practice algorithmic problems that often accompany system design interviews. Many companies combine system design with coding rounds.

## Starting a Coding Challenge

1. Navigate to "Coding" in the sidebar
2. Choose a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
3. Select a category (Arrays, Strings, Trees, etc.)
4. Optionally filter by company
5. Click "Start Challenge"

## Challenge Interface

### Problem Panel (Left)
- Problem title and description
- Constraints and requirements
- Example inputs and outputs
- Visible test cases

### Code Editor (Right)
- Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
- Multiple language support
- Auto-completion
- Error highlighting

## Supported Languages

- **Python** - Most popular for interviews
- **JavaScript** - Good for full-stack candidates
- **Java** - Common in enterprise companies
- **C++** - Preferred for performance-critical roles
- **C** - Systems programming
- **C#** - Microsoft ecosystem
- **Go** - Cloud-native development

## Problem Categories

### Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums
- **Strings**: Pattern matching, parsing, manipulation
- **Linked Lists**: Reversal, cycle detection, merging
- **Trees**: Traversal, BST operations, path problems
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path, topological sort
- **Heaps**: Priority queues, k-th element problems
- **Hash Tables**: Frequency counting, lookups

### Algorithms
- **Sorting**: Quick sort, merge sort, custom comparators
- **Searching**: Binary search, two pointers
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, tabulation
- **Greedy**: Interval scheduling, optimization
- **Backtracking**: Permutations, combinations
- **Divide and Conquer**: Recursive decomposition

## Evaluation Criteria

Your code is evaluated on:

1. **Correctness (40%)**
   - Does it produce correct output?
   - Does it handle all test cases?

2. **Efficiency (25%)**
   - Time complexity
   - Space complexity
   - Optimal algorithm choice

3. **Code Quality (20%)**
   - Readability
   - Variable naming
   - Code organization
   - Comments where needed

4. **Edge Cases (15%)**
   - Empty inputs
   - Single elements
   - Large inputs
   - Boundary conditions

## Test Cases

### Visible Tests
- Shown before you submit
- Use to verify basic functionality
- Include the examples from the problem

### Hidden Tests
- Run only after submission
- Test edge cases
- Verify performance on large inputs
- Determine final score

## Submitting Your Solution

1. Write your code in the editor
2. Click "Run Tests" to check visible test cases
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Click "Submit" for full evaluation
5. View your score and feedback

## Time Management

- Most challenges have a 45-minute time limit
- The timer is visible at the top
- Plan your approach before coding (5 minutes)
- Implement the solution (30 minutes)
- Test and debug (10 minutes)

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the problem carefully** - Understand requirements
2. **Think before coding** - Plan your approach
3. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
4. **Test with examples** - Verify your logic
5. **Handle edge cases** - Empty, single, boundary
6. **Optimize if needed** - Time/space trade-offs
7. **Write clean code** - Easy to read and debug

hey claude, its good and i need to add another option called coding, where users can code the questions keep it as interview or any type, user get the coding challanges with the time period with difficulty level and user can select the company or if the company is not available they give their company name difficult etc.. and we need to prepare the coding questions and ask them to code. Also we need it for the different languages like c, c#, java, c++, python, go , js etc... coding is nothing but the questions using llama model for it
